#🏏 IPL Win Prediction Probability

<h1>
  
📌 Problem Statement
</h1>
In this project, we aim to predict the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on live match conditions. Using past IPL match data, we train a machine learning model that takes match features like current score, wickets, overs, and target score to calculate real-time winning probabilities for both teams.
